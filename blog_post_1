We got our dataset from Kaggle, it is part of an old Kaggle competition. Our dataset includes information about different taxi rides, including the final fare cost, the time (day, month, year, hour of day). 

##Explorations so far: 

We have conducted comprehensive comparisons between attributes, in particular making a detailed comparison matrix and representing the findings graphically. This way we have been able to visually see what we think are more intriguing and noteworthy relationships between the attributes. It has also brought to our attention that some of the features are currently in a format that is unusable to us, in particular the date of the journey and location based on longitude and latitude lines, we will need to update that in the future.
