# Machine Learning Final Project 
Group MEMe

## Introduction: 

Within the metropolis of New York City, navigating the intricate web of transportation can be both a daily challenge and a financial puzzle. Our project addresses a ubiquitous problem: predicting taxi fares. In a city where prices for anything are impossible to predict, we created a tool to empower people in New York City, providing insights on how to navigate the city efficiently and economically. What may seem like an end of semester project, has high stakes: savings for individuals, reduced traffic, and a positive environmental impact.

## Understanding our Code:

If you would like to run this model yourself, please download both the file named ML_FP_Code.ipynb and the downlad the dataset form the Kaggle website as linked in our refrences on the final blog post. If you would like to know more about the process and our conclusions please see the document labeled Final Blog Post.
